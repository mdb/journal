# journal

A simple Wordpress theme's source code managed via a Grunt build process.

## Why?

Largely just a rough-around-the-edges experiment in better-managing an old Wordpress theme via an improved build process.

## Usage

journal requires Node.js, sass, and compass.

Build the theme:

    cd journal
    npm install
    grunt
